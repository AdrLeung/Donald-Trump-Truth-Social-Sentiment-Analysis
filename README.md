# Truth Social Sentiment Analysis Discord Bot
Adrian Leung
A Discord bot designed for pulling posts by Donald Trump and analyzing them for buy signals on ticker symbols.

## Motivations
Donald Trump has proven to have an immense impact on the stock market whenever he chooses to. On Wednesday, April 9th, 9:37am ET, he posted that "THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT," followed by a 90-day tariff pause less than 4 hours later. This pause caused the S&P 500 to gain 9.5%, the largest single-day gain in the past decade. This event sparked particular interest in me because:
- I like making money.
- It doesn't seem completely unlikely that this event will happen again.
- I would like to know when it happens without having to constantly check his posts.
Thus, I have created a Discord bot that pings a channel in my private Discord server whenever he posts on Truth Social, followed by an AI generated sentiment analysis that is done by ChatGPT using a specialized prompt.

## Features
- This Discord bot uses the publicly available [truthbrush](<https://github.com/stanfordio/truthbrush>) repository by stanfordio as an API client for Truth Social.
- The bot will send a message in a dedicated Discord Channel whenever Trump posts on Truth Social.
- The bot will perform a quick sentiment analysis on the post using ChatGPT with a specialized prompt.
